# Node Package Manager

NPM is basically a command line tool as well as a registry of third party libraries that we can add to our Node applications. 

So for pretty much any kind of functionality you want to add to your application there is most likely a free, open sourced library or package or node module, whatever you wan to call it on NPM registry.
